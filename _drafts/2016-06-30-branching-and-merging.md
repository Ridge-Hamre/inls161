Today we will set up a testing workflow and learn how to create branches for adding and changing features on our sites. 
We will use this to change the visual style the site and create blog posts. 

This session will be mostly hands-on.

# Set up testing environment

Testing and checking your work is a necessary part of doing any task. 
You don't send a paper off to your professor without proofreading it (you shouldn't, anyway). 
Similarly, you do not want to put a website online that you haven't tested. 

# Create a branch

# Edit your CSS 

# Test your branch

# Merge your branch into master

# Roll back a change

# For tomorrow

We're going to try a slightly different approach tomorrow. 
I'm going to cluster you in groups based on where you are in the process of completing assignment #1. 
It is okay if you are still early on: that is fine. 
I want to be able to collectively help you, though, and that will be easier to do if I know where you are and if you can help each other through tasks that are closer together in the overall workflow.
