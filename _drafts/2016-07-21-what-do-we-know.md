Today we are going to wrap up the class and talk about the skills that you are taking away from this experience. 
<excerpt/>

This information will be useful in the context of preparing a resume/CV or perhaps in conducting a job interview in which you are asked to talk about technical skills. 

We will work through this list together and then I will update this post at the end of class.

# During the exam period

The exam period for this class is {{ site.data.dates.exam.time }} on {{ site.data.dates.exam.date | date: "%A, %-d %B %Y" }}. 
You are all required to attend the exam session. 
We will be viewing everyone's presentations with Q&A to follow. 

This should not take the entire time alotted, but plan for at least an hour and half to be safe.
