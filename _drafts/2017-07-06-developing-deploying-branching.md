Today we're going to take the first steps toward actually getting our website up and running. 
We will also use this opportunity to discuss the development > testing > deployment workflow. 
<excerpt/>

We'll be using Barry Clark's tutorial as a reference, so you'll want to have that pulled up in a separate window so that you can switch back and forth to it. 

# Fork

We will do the same thing that we have previously done in GitHub and fork our chosen theme into our account as a starting place. 

That should be relatively straightforward now.


# Next time

We're going to learn tomorrow how to incorporate branching, testing, and merging by setting up a development workflow like the one described above. 

To prepare for this, I would like you to read the Gist linked in the margin, but I would also like you to do some searching online about how different developers managed their workflows. {sidenote 'workflow' 'blackfalcon. “Git Basics - a General Workflow.” Gist. Accessed June 29, 2016. https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401.'}
To this end you might Google things like "development workflow" or "project development."
See what you can find. 
There is a ton of relevant information on this topic out in the Internet.
