There are some compelling reasons that we might want to protect a directory within our website. 
If we have materials that we wish to serve, but only to specific people, adding a password to that directory is probably the easiest way to do this. 

There are two files that you will need in order to password protect a directory: an access file and a password file. 
The access file tells the webserver what kind of authentication is being used and the password file stores the usernames and encrypted passwords.
