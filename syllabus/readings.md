## Readings

There will be readings for each session, but they are not readings for memorization. 
Lectures will not necessarily follow the readings, and they might not even touch on all of the content in the readings. 
The purpose of the readings is to provide you a context within which to experience the lectures and exercises that follow. 
You will want to do the readings to have a framework within which to work. 
Additionally, readings will provide you with helpful information in support of the assignments associated with each class session. 

Most readings will be available either on the open web or through the univerity's proxy. 
Any that are not will be available in Sakai. 

There are a few longer pieces that will serve as optional or recommended readings that I will refer to over the course of the semester. 
These readings are more general pieces about computing and information technology in general, its history, and its future. 

### What is Code?

Ford, P. (2015, June 11). [What Is Code? If You Donâ€™t Know, You Need to Read This](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). Retrieved from http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/

This is an excellent piece about the need for people at all levels in industries both technologically-focused and otherwise to have a better understanding of how software is developed and implemented. 
I will refer to this piece occasionally and sections of it will be assigned throughout the course. 
It is probably a good idea to read the whole thing.

### The Linux Command Line

This book will give you everything you need to be able to operate in a command shell. 
It is a good reference for everything command line.

The definitive guide to using git. 
This will come in handy. 

Additionally, the following resources for using git will be very helpful. 
They may be used in class for reference.

Wynn, J. (2014, May 25). [A Hacker's Guide to Git](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/). Retrieved from http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/

### How to Code in HTML5 and CSS3

Wielgosik, D. (2015). [How to Code in HTML5 and CSS3](http://howtocodeinhtml.com/index.html). Retrieved from http://howtocodeinhtml.com/index.html

Good introduction to HTML and CSS. 
We will be referring to this and other guides. 

### The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint

Tufte, E. R. (2011). The Cognitive Style of Powerpoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within. Cheshire, Connecticut: Graphics Press. [Available in Sakai.]

We will use this to unlearn what we have learned and then reorient our minds to create better visual presentation aides. 
Definitely read the whole thing. 

## Session Notes

Pay attention to the [schedule]({{ base.url }}/schedule/). 
Session notes will be posted prior to each class and you would do well to look over the links before coming to class. 
If there is something that you should before coming to class, it will be included on the session notes for the session prior to the class you will be preparing for.

## Other Resources

Part of your responsibility for this class is investigating and sharing resources that you find on the web or elsewhere that you think might be helpful to us. 
The best and most current resources for using technology tools are not going to be found between the pages of books. 
Rather, they will be on forums, blogs, and in ebooks like some of those listed above. 
They best way to keep abreast of current techniques is to keep up with the resources and tutorials available online.
