## Lab

One day of the week will be reserved as a lab session. 
This means that we will typically have a very short lesson accompanied by a large, complex task to be completed within the lab session if possible. 
Sometimes we will have a guest on days like this who will show us something interesting that we can put into practice. 

### Computers

You can use whatever computer you wish in the lab that we will use as our classroom. 
You may also use your own laptops. 
If you need help installing or configuring a piece of software, I will be available to help you outside of class. 
Most of our activity will be conducted through web applications in-browser. 
This will hopefully ease the burden of installing and configuring considerably.
