**Due: Within the first week of class.** 

This assignment is somewhat amorphous. 
It is really an assessment of your ability to use the command line and understand version control. 

The basic component is that you will have your GitHub.com account set up and get yourself set up on CodeAnywhere.com so that you have a workspace. 
Since we will be working with this in class, it is impossible for you not to do this in full. 
Luckily, in doing the setup and getting used to the command line, you will prepare yourself for all of the assignments that follow. 

## Assessment

I will assess whether this task has been completed by asking you to send me your GitHub username so that I may add it to a class group. 

That is it.
That simple. 

This is worth 20% of your total grade, which is reflective of the centrality of using the command shell, text editors and version control to the goals of this class.
