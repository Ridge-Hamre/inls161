**Due: 2015-07-15**

This assignment involves creating a spreadsheet from scratch in plaintext.

Instructions:

1. Beginning with a blank document, write a line of text with values for different variables. We will discuss this in class and create a set of variables that we will all use. 
2. Aggregate the data that you have created with that of the other students in the class. 
3. Save all of this as a CSV file. 
4. Open the CSV file in LibreOffice and format it so that the head row with the variable names is in bold. Then save the file as ODS or XLSX. You can also save both to compare. 
5. Freeze the first row of data. 
6. Upload and link your CSV and ODS/XLSX files on your website. 

## Grading

Grading for this assignment is based on the completeness of your fileset and also of the data in the files. You should have two (or more) files linked on your site:

1. example.csv
2. example.ods OR example.xlsx (OR BOTH)

The files, internally, should contain data from every student in the class who committed a change to the shared repository (this will be fully explained in class).

The spreadsheet assignment is worth 5% of your total grade.
