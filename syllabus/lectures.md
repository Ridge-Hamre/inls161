## Lectures

### Lecture Notes

Class sessions will have online lecture notes (which will include links to supplementary readings). 
The notes will also include practical exercises that may either be required or recommended (pay attention to which is which), links to other related sources of information on the topic under consideration, and required readings for the subsequent session.
Some lecture notes will be very detailed and loaded with images; some lecture notes will be spare and loaded with hyperlinks (recognize that links may change over time).

Refer to the lecture notes either to prepare for what you are going to learn or to review what you have learned.
Lecture notes will be made available before each class session. 
See the [schedule]({{ base.url }}/schedule/) for links to lecture notes. 

### Daily Plan

What follows is a typical plan. 
All sessions will not look like this, but many will.

The first 5 to 10 minutes will be reviewing the material from the previous session. 
This will be mostly done by you. 
You will talk about what you learned and I will listen.

The next 50 to 60 minutes will consist of lecture (mostly); examples (a lot); discussion (a fair amount); and practice (some).

The last 20 to 30 minutes will be for practice (more) when we have the time and hands-on-keyboards activities (most days).
