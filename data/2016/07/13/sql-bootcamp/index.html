<p class="subtitle">Wednesday, 13 July 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smaller date contrast">TODAY</span></p>

<p>Today we will jump head-first into working with databases as an extension of our discussions earlier in the week about data.<br>
<excerpt/></p>

<p>A &quot;database&quot; is a collection of information, arranged or organized in some meaningful way so as to aid the retrieval of that information. 
The types of information stored in databases vary based on the purpose and application. </p>

<p>When we refer to databases now, we usually mean electronic databases or DataBase Management Systems (DBMS). 
However, databases can exist in a number of non-electonic forms (and have for much of human history).</p>

<p>What are some examples of non-electronic databases?</p>

<h1 id="what-goes-into-a-database?">What goes into a database?</h1>

<p>Pieces of information, or objects, are stored in a database in a structured way. 
The objects are sorted into classes according to type. 
This approach is referred to as &quot;object-oriented,&quot; which we have briefly touched on over the course of the semester. </p>

<p>When data are entered into a database, each object, or chunk of information, is assigned a class that allows for sorting and recall. </p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-information-go-in?">How does the information go in?</h2>

<p>There are a number of different ways to get data into a database. </p>

<p>We can import tables directly from files. 
We can also input data one at a time using an entry form. 
We will do both of these things over the next few days. </p>

<p>Today we will start by experimenting with opening the CSV we made the other day as a table. </p>

<h2 id="electronic-dbms">Electronic DBMS</h2>

<p>There are myriad choices for DMBS implementations. 
A commonly used system is called MySQL, which is based in a database language called SQL (Structured Query Language). </p>

<p>You will also hear of NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB. 
These use an entirely different internal logic to store and recall data that that of SQL-based systems. </p>

<p>There are a great many front-end user interfaces for these systems. 
MSAccess has been used for years for all sorts of applications. </p>

<p>We will use the LibreOffice Base package. 
It is an open-source analog to Access and will allow us to do the same things. 
One major benefit of this is that we will be able to open our database without being locked to MSAccess. 
At present, there is no way to open an Access DB in another program. 
We wish to avoid that. </p>

<h1 id="install-mysql">Install MySQL</h1>

<p>We will install MySQL so that we can create and explore a database using the SQL shell in our CodeAnywhere containers.</p>

<h1 id="system-maintenance">System maintenance</h1>

<p>First update and upgrade all packages:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</code></p>

<p>We will need to make some space on our containers to install MySQL. </p>

<p>We no longer need <code>unoconv</code>, so let&#39;s get rid of it:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get remove unoconv</code></p>

<p>When that is done, we can remove all of its dependencies:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get autoremove --purge</code></p>

<p>And then just for good measure, let&#39;s clean out our package cache:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get autoclean &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get clean</code></p>

<h1 id="install-the-mysql-client-and-server-packages">Install the MySQL client and server packages</h1>

<p>Then we have to install one dependency, without which the install will fail:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install bsdutils</code></p>

<p>Then install both the MySQL server and client packages in separate commands. </p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server</code></p>

<p>This will ask you to create a password for the MySQL root user. 
Since we are only trying things out today and not installing this for the purpose of running a real SQL server, just put <code>changethis</code> as the root password. </p>

<p>Then install the client:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install mysql-client</code></p>

<h1 id="get-some-data">Get some data</h1>

<p>Let&#39;s download some CSV files that I prepared with our books list in them. </p>

<p><code>wget http://inls161.johndmart.in/raw-material/tblBook.csv</code> </p>

<p><code>wget http://inls161.johndmart.in/raw-material/tblPub.csv</code></p>

<h1 id="the-mysql-prompt">The MySQL prompt</h1>

<p>Once we are all installed, issue the <code>mysql</code> command to get into the <code>mysql&gt;</code> prompt:</p>

<p><code>mysql -u root -p</code></p>

<p>This specifies that you want to use the root user to login to the MySQL prompt. </p>

<p>Next let&#39;s create a new DB. Make sure that your prompt looks like this:</p>

<p><code>mysql&gt;</code></p>

<p>If it does, then you can type:</p>

<p><code>CREATE DATABASE booksinfo;</code></p>

<p>Commands in the mysql&gt; prompt are <em>case-sensitive,</em> so pay attention to the case of the commands. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s list our DBs:</p>

<p><code>show databases;</code></p>

<p>We should see the DB with the name that we created in the list. Let&#39;s move into it:</p>

<p><code>USE booksinfo;</code></p>

<h1 id="add-tables">Add tables</h1>

<p>Now we have to create two tables so that we can import data from our CSV files.</p>

<p><code>CREATE TABLE tblBook (ID INT, Title VARCHAR(255), Date INT, RetailPrice DECIMAL(5,2), Copies INT, ShelfNumber VARCHAR(255), PubID INT);</code></p>

<p><code>CREATE TABLE tblPub (ID INT, Publisher VARCHAR(255), City VARCHAR(255), State VARCHAR(255), Country VARCHAR(255));</code></p>

<p>See what tables we have just created:</p>

<p><code>show tables;</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s import some tables from the files we downloaded earlier:</p>

<p><code>LOAD DATA INFILE &#39;/home/cabox/workspace/tblBook.csv&#39; INTO TABLE tblBook FIELDS TERMINATED BY &#39;,&#39; OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY &#39;&quot;&#39;;</code></p>

<p>This should give us some output. 
If we notice a warning, type the following to view the warnings:</p>

<p><code>SHOW WARNINGS;</code></p>

<p>So, it looks like we have a missing date. 
No big deal. 
We&#39;ll deal with that later. 
Let&#39;s import our other table. </p>

<p><code>LOAD DATA INFILE &#39;/home/cabox/workspace/tblPub.csv&#39; INTO TABLE tblPub FIELDS TERMINATED BY &#39;,&#39; OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY &#39;&quot;&#39;;</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what is in our tables:</p>

<p><code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p><code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tblPub;</code></p>

<p>We&#39;ll notice that we have no key set for either table. 
We need to do this, right?</p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE tblBook ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);</code></p>

<p>Now look at the table again and see that it has changed:</p>

<p><code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p>Now do the same for the other table:</p>

<p><code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tblPub;</code></p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE tblPub ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);</code></p>

<h1 id="define-relationships">Define relationships</h1>

<p>We need to tell MySQL that the PubID column in tblBook refers to the primary key in tblPub. This action is called a constraint and the reference is called a foreign key. </p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE tblBook ADD CONSTRAINT fk_PubID FOREIGN KEY (PubID) REFERENCES tblPub(ID) ON UPDATE NO ACTION;</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at our columns again:</p>

<p><code>SHOW COLUMNS FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that the &#39;Key&#39; column now has &#39;MUL&#39; for PubID. 
This means that we are using that column as an index as well as the primary key column. 
This new index just happens to be non-unique. </p>

<h1 id="summaries">Summaries</h1>

<p>So now that we have our data in place, let&#39;s summarize it a bit. </p>

<p><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p>What if we want to see the first ten rows in tblBook?</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM tblBook ORDER BY Date LIMIT 10;</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at only books published after 1980;</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM tblBook WHERE Date &gt; 1980 ORDER BY Date;</code></p>

<p>And count them:</p>

<p><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tblBook WHERE Date &gt; 1980 ORDER BY Date;</code></p>

<p>How about only books published in 1980?</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM tblBook WHERE Date = 1980 ORDER BY ShelfNumber;</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s find out how much our books cost:</p>

<p><code>SELECT AVG(RetailPrice) FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p><code>SELECT MIN(RetailPrice) FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p><code>SELECT MAX(RetailPrice) FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p>Let&#39;s summarize all of that together.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="k">SELECT</span> 
<span class="k">AVG</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RetailPrice</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="s1">'Average Price'</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="k">MIN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RetailPrice</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="s1">'Lowest Price'</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="k">MAX</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RetailPrice</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="s1">'Highest Price'</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">tblBook</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="queries">Queries</h1>

<p>Let&#39;s try something that I posed the other day in class. 
I want to list out all the books in the list that were published by Oxford University Press. </p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM tblBook b RIGHT JOIN tblPub p ON b.PubID = p.ID WHERE p.Publisher = &#39;Oxford University Press&#39;;</code></p>

<p>How many locations does OUP have? </p>

<p><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tblPub WHERE Publisher = &#39;Oxford University Press&#39;;</code></p>

<p>Where are they?</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM tblPub WHERE Publisher = &#39;Oxford University Press&#39;;</code></p>

<p>What if I only want the books published by OUP&#39;s US office? 
I have to specify an additional criterion. </p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM tblBook b RIGHT JOIN tblPub p ON b.PubID = p.ID WHERE p.Publisher = &#39;Oxford University Press&#39; AND p.Country = &#39;US&#39;;</code></p>

<p>I wonder if books cost more from the OUP GB location than from the OUP US location.</p>

<p><code>SELECT AVG(RetailPrice) FROM tblBook b RIGHT JOIN tblPub p ON b.PubID = p.ID WHERE p.Publisher = &#39;Oxford University Press&#39; AND p.Country = &#39;GB&#39;;</code></p>

<p><code>SELECT AVG(RetailPrice) FROM tblBook b RIGHT JOIN tblPub p ON b.PubID = p.ID WHERE p.Publisher = &#39;Oxford University Press&#39; AND p.Country = &#39;US&#39;;</code></p>

<h1 id="output-from-mysql-queries-as-tables">Output from MySQL queries as tables</h1>

<p>We can take any of the above queries and output the results to a table. </p>

<p>We need to add <code>CREATE TABLE qryName</code> to the front of any of our query commands. </p>

<p>Here is an example using our price summary from above:</p>

<p><code>CREATE TABLE qryPrices SELECT AVG(RetailPrice) AS &#39;Average Price&#39;, MIN(RetailPrice) AS &#39;Lowest Price&#39;, MAX(RetailPrice) AS &#39;Highest Price&#39; FROM tblBook;</code></p>

<p>See if it worked by listing the tables:</p>

<p><code>show tables;</code></p>

<p>Look at what is in the new table:</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM qryPrices</code></p>

<p>It should match the output from when you ran the query before. </p>

<h1 id="output-from-mysql-queries-in-other-formats">Output from MySQL queries in other formats</h1>

<p>We can output all of this stuff outside of our MySQL prompt shell (in a normal shell).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s ask for the summary of book prices in HTML and then we can try some other queries if we have time. </p>

<p><code>quit</code> to exit the MySQL prompt.</p>

<p>Now you have exited from the MySql prompt.</p>

<p><code>mysql -u root -p -H -e &quot;SELECT AVG(RetailPrice) AS &#39;Average Price&#39;, MIN(RetailPrice) AS &#39;Lowest Price&#39;, MAX(RetailPrice) AS &#39;Highest Price&#39; FROM tblBook;&quot; booksinfo</code></p>

<h1 id="exporting-and-importing">Exporting and Importing</h1>

<p>To export your whole database so that you can use it elsewhere (i.e., transfer it to a different server) do the following command:</p>

<p><code>mysqldump -u root -p booksinfo &gt; booksinfo.sql</code></p>

<p>If you want to then import that same database somewhere else, the command is very similar. The direction changes, and instead of the specialized <code>mysqldump</code> command, you use just the standard MySQL client command:</p>

<p><code>mysql -u root -p booksinfo &lt; booksinfo.sql</code></p>

<h1 id="for-next-time">For next time</h1>

<p>Tomorrow, we will return to databases and discuss the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of what we worked on today. 
I would like you to read something about databases.<label for='db' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'></label><input type='checkbox' id='db' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='sidenote'>“What Is a Database?” BBC Guides. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z8yk87h">http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z8yk87h</a>. </span></p>

<p>We will look at other resources and tutorials in class as well. </p>
