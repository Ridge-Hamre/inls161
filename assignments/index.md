# Assignment \#1: Get on GitHub

This assignment is very simple. 
You will have completed most of it in class by the end of the week. 

It involves: 1) setting up a GitHub user account; 2) using that account to log into CodeAnywhere; 3) forking the first assignment repository for practice; 4) taking a brief (6 minutes) questionnaire about yourself.
