# Task \#1: Version control setup

This assignment is pretty simple. 
It has 4 parts, most of which you will likely have done in class. 

Please complete these by Thursday night (23 June 2016) at the latest. 

Steps: 

1. Create GitHub username ([http://github.com](http://github.com)).
2. Use GitHub username to log into CodeAnywhere ([http://codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com)). 
3. Fork this repository into your GitHub account. 
4. Respond to the beginning of class questionnaire [https://unc.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_03dQuGyMQVqXZEF](https://unc.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_03dQuGyMQVqXZEF). 

## GitHub username

If you were in class the other day, you set up a GitHub username. 
Your first assignment is basically that. 

## CodeAnywhere

Now that you have it, you'll need to log into CodeAnywhere and set up an HTML5 container that runs Ubuntu. 
You can look here for some tips about how to do that: http://docs.codeanywhere.com/connections/github.html

We will go over this in class again as well. 

## Fork this repository

If you have arrived at this page, then you should see the GitHub interface in front of you. 
This is a repo (short for repository). 

This is mostly just practice, but I will see it as soon as you have done it, so it lets me know that you have engaged with this task. 

You need to fork this so that there is a tracked copy of it in your GitHub account. 
This is a way of copying which allows for the system to see how changes and updates to source code propagate, merge, and diverge over time. 
You will do this with other assignment repositories in the future as well. 

We'll look at this in class. 

For now, all you have to do is click the "Fork" button over in the upper right corner of the page, select your account, and then wait. 
It will tell you when it is finished. 

## Questionnaire

Then answer the beginning of class questionnaire. 

All you need to do is click the link below and answer all the questions. When you get to the end, your responses will automatically be recorded.

And that's it!
