Today we're going to learn how to fork, clone, and push changes to a repository on GitHub using git. 
We do this in preparation for creating personal websites that will be hosted by GitHub pages. 

# Fork

The first thing that we are going to do today is fork some code that will allow us to have something to work with in CodeAnywhere later.
We'll use this as an opportunity to get wome web code and see what that looks like. 

You are not committing to anything today: this is just for practice. 
We'll start by going to this repo:

# For next time

I would like you to have a look at some tutorials and guides to Markdown for Monday. 

Kirk Strobeck's page describes the origin and intent of Markdown, and provides links to useful resources.

Dan Harper gives a good introduction to how Markdown is used and what it looks like in the wild.
