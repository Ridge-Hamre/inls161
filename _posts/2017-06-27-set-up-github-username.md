This assignment is simple. 
It consists of 4 tasks:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account and log into CodeAnywhere. 
3. Take the first quiz. 
2. Take the beginning questionnaire. 
4. Make a commit on GitHub. 

Once you have done these, you have completed the first assignment. 
You will likely have done these things by the time we finish class on Tuesday.
