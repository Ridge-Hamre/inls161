<p><strong>Due: IN CLASS 2015-07-27</strong></p>

<p>This is your final assignment. </p>

<p>The task this time is to create a self-running presentation that summarizes or expands upon something that we have learned this semester. 
You may use this opportunity to pitch some of the skills that you have learned, demonstrate your expertise in a certain area, or discuss aspect of technology or computing (or anything else) that is of interest to you.</p>

<p>You may use any presentation tool you prefer for this task, but not all of them can do all that the task calls for. 
You may have to use multiple tools. 
One method is to create a presentation and then narrate over it as you move through the slides and capture the entire thing in a video. 
This is the method I am most likely to use, for instance. </p>

<p>Whatever tool you use, the final product needs to be as platform-independent as possible. 
This means that we should be able to view it on virtually any system and not have to have a specific system in place to open the presentation. 
We will look at ways to do this in class this week. </p>

<h2 id="topic">Topic</h2>

<p>You may choose the topic of your presentation.</p>

<p>If you cannot think of a topic you want to use, select one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>  create a visual résumé that introduces you to a potential employer or to someone or some organization you want to hire/select you for something</li>
<li>  create a presentation talking about your home town, home state, or anything else associated with your roots. Make it a product that will help the viewer learn about the topic and entice the viewer to want to learn more.</li>
<li>  do a critique of this class - what did it cover, what was good about it, what could be done better. Be critical and make recommendations. I will take the comments to heart and put them into effect where possible, but your grade on this task and this course will be based solely on the quality of the presentation itself in terms of design, execution, clarity of content, and performance.</li>
<li>  comment on the utility of one or more of the tools that we learned about in the class - talk about the tool, its origins, the tasks it focuses on, and some ways to make use of it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternative">Alternative</h2>

<p>If you have a need to create a presentation that satisfies a requirement for another class you are taking, you may use this presentation to do just that.</p>

<p>If you choose the this option, tell me via email by Monday 20 July.</p>

<p>Even though this presentation will be intended to satisfy a requirement in another class, you do need to display the requisite skills that we cover in class this week in terms of design and execution. </p>

<p>The objectives for both assignments should be complementary. In particular, the specifications for this presentation preclude use of bulleted lists in most cases, so you may have to make significant modifications to your existing presentation.</p>

<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>

<p>You may work alone or in teams. If you choose to work as a team, I need to hear the voices of all the team members in the slide narrations.</p>

<p>Your goal is to create a single presentation that simultaneously satisfies two objectives:</p>

<ol>
<li> It will be a self-running presentation of anywhere from 10-15 minutes that incorporates slide timing and your narration.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>  This presentation will run automatically just as if you were delivering the presentation live.</li>
<li>  I will see the slides, hear your narration, and observe images and objects in the order and timing you wish them to appear.</li>
<li>  I will use this version to decide on the points for aesthetics and delivery.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li> However, the presentation should be created as if you were, in fact, going to present it live.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>  It should be set up with delivery tools, in particular with on-screen navigation tools, so that you could present it and have total control over how it would run.</li>
<li>  We will cover this requirement in more detail during the delivery session.</li>
<li>  I will use your design to decide on the points for formatting decisions and preparation.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may create this presentation alone or you may work in teams of up to 3. If you wish to work in a team, you will need to create a shared repository for your work. When you or your team has completed the task, each of the members of the team will place a hyperlink to it on their respective web sites. 
When it&#39;s ready for me to download and grade, send me a note telling me to retrieve it from your websites.</p>

<p>The saved presentation will include both the visuals and any accompanying sound files.
You should also include a script or notes with the other files. </p>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

<p>We will all view the presentations in class on the exam day. 
The exam day session will run from 11:30am - 2:30pm (11:30-14:30 EDT) on Monday, 27 July, 2015.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>YOUR PRESENTATION IS DUE ON THE EXAM DAY WHEN THE SESSION STARTS. 
It should be commited to your presentation repo in Github. </p>

<p>This assignment will comprise 15% of your total grade. </p>
