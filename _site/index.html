          <p>According to the American Library Association, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Information literacy is related to information technology skills, but has broader implications for the individual, the educational system, and for society. 
Information technology skills enable an individual to use computers, software applications, databases, and other technologies to achieve a wide variety of academic, work-related, and personal goals. 
Information literate individuals necessarily develop some technology skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Increasingly, information technology skills are interwoven with, and support, information literacy.</p>

<p>A full information literacy curriculum would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Tool literacy:</strong> The ability to use print and electronic resources including software</li>
<li>  <em>Resource literacy:</em> The ability to understand the form, format, location and access methods of information resources</li>
<li>  <em>Social-structural literacy:</em> Knowledge of how information is socially situated and produced. It includes understanding the scholarly publishing process</li>
<li>  <em>Research literacy:</em> The ability to understand and use information technology tools to carry our research including discipline-related software</li>
<li>  <em>Publishing literacy:</em> The ability to produce a text or multimedia report of the results of research</li>
</ul>

<p>At SILS, INLS151 focuses on concepts and techniques for finding and evaluating information, while INLS161-001 will focus on concepts and the tools needed to communicate your information to users.
We will begin with the building blocks of the Internet and the World Wide Web, to be certain we understand what the basic tools are doing for us. This will allow us to know how to create well-formed materials to be used on the Web.</p>

<p>We will also introduce concepts and practice skills germane to effective use of the power built into word processing, spreadsheet, relational database management, and presentation graphics software. Although we may use either the current Open Office or the current Microsoft Office suites of applications for many tasks, the basic concepts should provide you with skills that will enable you to be comfortable with other similar packages.</p>
