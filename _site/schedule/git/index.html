<p>We will use Git as our version control system in this class. 
Git has an interesting past and was developed out of necessity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Short History of Git</strong></p>

<p>As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>

<p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:</p>

<p>Speed</p>

<p>Simple design</p>

<p>Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</p>

<p>Fully distributed</p>

<p>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</p>

<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development (<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git">Chacon &amp; Straub, 2014</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the development of Git is tied to the development of the Linux kernel, but it doesn&#39;t end there. 
It has come to be used in millions of projects and development workflows. 
Its versatility has also inspired people to develop new layers of interaction to work with it. 
We will discuss and explore one of those today and then use it for the rest of the semester. </p>

<p>First, though, lets explore Git, starting with the elegantly designed <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">Git: The Simple Guide</a> by Roger Dudler.</p>
