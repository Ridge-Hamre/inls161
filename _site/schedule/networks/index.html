<h2 id="networks">Networks</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve discussed a bit about how servers and clients operate. 
Now we&#39;ll look at what happens when we put lots of servers and lots of clients together. </p>

<p>A network is a relatively simple concept with some complex underlying technologies. 
Each computer or device in a network can be referred to as a &quot;node.&quot; </p>

<p>Information is transmitted through networks in something called a &quot;packet.&quot;</p>

<p>Packets of information are sent from node to node through paths called &quot;routes.&quot;</p>

<p>A &quot;router&quot; is a device that receives packets and sends them on to their destination. </p>

<p>We briefly discussed ports. 
Remember, a port allows for two devices to communicate and specify a protocol through which to conduct that communication. 
Ports are not physical, while routes might be virtual, physical or both. </p>

<p>Some of the ports that we have encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li>  8000 (HTTP)</li>
<li>  443 (HTTPS)</li>
<li>  21 (FTP)</li>
<li>  22 (SSH)</li>
</ul>

<p>A relatively complete list of ports is avaiable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-networks-topology">Types of networks (topology)</h3>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/NetworkTopologies.svg" target="_blank" ><img width="200px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/NetworkTopologies.svg/200px-NetworkTopologies.svg.png" alt="Types of networks" /></a></p>

<p>Different networks have different physical or virtual arrangements of devices. 
Above are a few examples, visualized. </p>

<p>Most of the networks that we deal with on a given day are star networks. 
They might be connected to other star networks so that you will end up with a star of stars. 
In these networks each device connects to a node and then that node sends them elsewhere on the network. 
The node that is used to connect is usually either a router or switch of some kind. 
Connections occur through a single path. 
If a connection is lost, either through physical network failure or through software failure, it is not possible to re-establish the connection unless the route is restored. </p>

<p>Most local area networks (LANs) operate in this way. </p>

<p>Some networks allow any device to connect to any other device. 
These are called mesh networks. </p>

<p>A mesh network is self-healing, which means that if a connection is dropped between any two given devices, the same connection can be re-established through a different route. 
These networks are not typically in use on LANs, but there is a very large one that we interact with on a near-continuous basis. </p>
