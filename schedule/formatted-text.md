This week we will discuss more of the uses of plaintext and markup. 
We will also have some hand-on-keyboards excercises that will demonstrate the power of using marked-up plaintext for creating formatted documents. 

Today's class is part review and clarification and then mostly in-class exercises. 

We take a plaintext file that we have downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org) and mark it up using Markdown. 

This file can be used as the basis for [assignment #3 on formatted text documents]({{ base.url }}/syllabus/assignments/assignment3/).
