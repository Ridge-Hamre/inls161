HTML is an acronym for "HyperText Markup Language."

"Hypertext" is text that contains links to other text. 
The Web, as we know it, relies on hypertext to for us to communicate with systems and with other humans. 
It is the medium of Web content.

HTML5 is the latest iteration of a standard related to the writing of web content. 

For a good history of markup for the web, please review the following:
