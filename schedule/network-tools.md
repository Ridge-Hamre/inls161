Today we will work with several tools which allow us to see what is going on underneath the shiny, pretty surface of the Internet that we all know and love. 

We will use and consider the following tools:

1. [whoami](http://linux.die.net/man/1/whoami)
2. [finger](http://linux.die.net/man/1/finger)
3. [ping](http://linux.die.net/man/8/ping)
4. [whois](http://linux.die.net/man/1/whois)
5. [dig](http://linux.die.net/man/1/dig)
6. [wget](http://linux.die.net/man/1/wget)
7. [nmap](http://linux.die.net/man/1/nmap)

These will be included in our [reference sheet]({{ base.url }}/refsheets/network-ref.md) for today's session. 

**For next time:**

Please review the following: 

Wynn, J. (2014, May 25). [A Hacker's Guide to Git](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/). Retrieved from http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/ 

This piece describes how version control works using the context of *git*, which we will be using in class for the rest of the semester. 
It is a very good idea to familiarize yourself with how it works. 

Dudler, R. (2015). [Git: The Simple Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). Retrieved from http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

This is an EXCELLENT entry level tutorial about installing and using *git*. 
Please familiarize yourself with the commands and download the [cheat sheet](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf). 
It will help you immensely as we proceed through the semester.
