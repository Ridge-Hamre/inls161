In this class, we are going to use LibreOffice, which is an open-source productivity suite. 
There are several reasons for choosing an open-source tool. 

1. The software is free to download and use. 
2. The community of developers and users interact to create a more robust product and better user experience.
3. I don't like using MicroSoft products if I can avoid it. 

So, if you want to use MSOffice for the course, you are welcome to do so, but know that my examples will be tailored to LibreOffice. 
This is not a huge obstacle, but it does mean that you will need to do a little bit more work on your own to figure out how the tools are similar and different. 

LibreOffice should be installed on the lab computers. 
However, it is a good idea to install it on your laptops or computers as well. 

Here is a link to download LibreOffice: https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/

Here is a link to a good installation tutorial, tailored to your operating system: https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/

### Writer

LibreOffice contains several tools. 
One of them is a package called Writer. 
Writer is analog to MSWord. 

Writer is a word processor. 

A question to consider: What is a word processor and how does it work?

We'll discuss this in class.
