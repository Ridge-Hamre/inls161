One simple fomat for structured data is a table. 

Rows in the table represent individual cases or instances of something. 

Columns represent variables. 

What is the difference? 

In the data that we are going to create in class, our rows will represent individual people. 
The information contained in these rows will be given ("datum, a thing given") to us by every member of this class. 
The columns will represent a specifically defined aspect of data that we gather about every individual person. 

We will start with making our own individual lists and then aggregate them.
