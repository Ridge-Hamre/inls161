[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is a universal document converter. 

Without oversimplifying matters too much, it suffices to say that Pandoc is an awesome tool to have in our arsenal. 

It allows us to convert from most any document type we can think of to any other type. 
This is very good for collaborating and working with groups on documents for publication. 
You can also use Pandoc to create presentation materials from source files or to extract text from a formatted document into plaintext. 

Today we are going to briefly introduce Pandoc and then tomorrow we are going to see what it can really do with our documents when we learn some interesting switches and tricks. 

First things first, we need to install Pandoc. 
You will need to do this in CodeAnywhere, but you can also install it on your own laptop if you like. 

Here is a link to the installation documentation for Pandoc: http://pandoc.org/installing.html

We'll review it in class and install Pandoc in our CodeAnywhere DevBoxes. 
If you would like help installing it on your own machines, I will be available before and after class this week to assist you with that task.
