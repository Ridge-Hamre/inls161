A "client" in the context of computing is any hardware or software that is used to connect to a service being run on a server.

Almost every device that you interact with now is a client. 
Each time your phone reaches out to see if you have new messages, it is a client. 
When you go to web browser to bring up Facebook, your computer is a client. 
When you you talk to Siri or Alexa or Google Now or whatever creepy robot voice you talk to, your are talking to a client which sends your request out to a server for processing. 

Very little in the networked world operates locally, and that is as it should be.
