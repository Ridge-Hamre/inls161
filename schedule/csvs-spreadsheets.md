### More fun with CSVs

It would be a good idea to look over this to review working with CSVs and lists of data in the command line:

Connelly, B. (2013, September 23). Working with CSVs on the Command Line. Retrieved from http://bconnelly.net/working-with-csvs-on-the-command-line/

There are a great deal of useful commands in that tutorial that can help you in dealing with data in a command shell. 

### CSV to spreadsheet

Spreadsheets appear to operate in a very simple manner, storing data in rows and columns just like any other table, but looks can be deceiving. 

Just like with DOCX and ODT files when compared with plaintext files, spreadsheets hide a lot of metadata underneath what appears on the surface. 

Unlike with the relationship between plaintext and interface-wrapped formatted text files, it is more difficult to get all of the information out of the spreadsheet.
