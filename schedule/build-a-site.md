Today we are going to start off with a Jekyll theme, clone it into our site directory, explore it, and then push it to our GitHub repo to see what it looks like. 

We'll go through some of the basics in class together, but you will mostly be on your own. I'll be available to help as needed. I will set up a class blog site for us while you all set up your personal sites. 

Look through the themes at: http://jekyllthemes.org/

You'll probably want to use the Jekyll Cheatsheet by Rico Sta. Cruz to help figure out what is what inside Jekyll: http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/jekyll.html
