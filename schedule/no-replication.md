All of the tools and tasks that we cover in this course can be used to make our lives easier and our workflows simpler. 
They can also be used to make our lives harder. 
That is not the intent of this course. 
We're here to learn about new and flexible ways of completing tasks that involve the communication of information. 

Inevitably, someone (usually a boss or instructor) will demand that you use a specific tool to complete a task. 
On that day, knowing what you know after taking this class, you will be able to not only suggest alternatives, but you will also be able to make a compelling argument as to why those alternatives are better, more flexible and will save work in the long run. 

If you are particularly talented or skilled, you will go off on your own and use whatever workflow you want and then produce the output requested by your boss or instructor. 
They never have to know the difference and can be blissfully unaware of the the technical prowess that went into creating the Word document that they only want so that they can print onto dead trees and then give back to you with red pen marks all over it. 

The triumph in learning these tools is that you will know that there is a better way, and you will use that way whenever you can. 
And in the end, when you are in charge, you can set the workflows and toolchains and collaboration environments. 

You will be equipped to do that. 

### Down with Word, Up with Creativity

For an excellent, eloquent, logical rant about why MicroSoft Word has to go, see this blog post by science-fiction author Charles Stross: http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html

Stross believes that tools like Word stifle creativity by shackling you to an interface. 

I believe the same thing. 
Don Knuth, famed computer scientist, believed the same thing about writing and typesetting for scientists in the 1970s. 
It is because of his disdain for the arduous process involved in getting your work to print that he invented TeX. 
He believed that TeX freed writers and allowed them to return to their content and not worry so much about presentation. 

We do not have enough time in this class to cover TeX, but we can discuss it briefly in this week's lab session in relation to using Pandoc for creating PDFs from our document sources. 

**For tomorrow:** 

Please review this tutorial on getting away from Word (and word processors): http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2015/ilw-pandoc/

It is my hope that at least a few of you will be convinced to try some new ways of being creative and managing your work. 
We will use some of the techniques from that tutorial for the rest of the week.
