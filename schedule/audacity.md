### Installing Audacity

Look for the correct installer at the download site for Audacity's current version. 
DMG for Mac and EXE for windows. 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/files/audacity/2.1.0/

Install the software as you normally would install something. 

Specific instructions here, if you need to troubleshoot: http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html

### Recording audio

Make sure that you have a microphone plugged and then open Audacity. 

To record, press the record button on the top bar or press SHIFT+R. 

To stop, press the SPACE BAR. 

For playback of audio that you have just recorded, press the SPACE BAR again. 

You can move backward and forward in the track by using the LEFT <- and RIGHT -> cursor keys. 

It is a good idea to save as you go, so that you do not lose anything. 

The file will save as an AUP file. 
That is Audacity's project file format. 
It will allow you to open the whole project with all of your audio saved in it. 

Look here for documentation about getting started recording your audio:

#### Recording chunks of audio for each slide

If you want to record audio for each slide event in an individual file, which is a good approach, simply record the audio and then when you are satisfied with it, export it as an OGG Vorbis file. 

You can press CTRL+SHIFT+E or select "Export Audio..." from the "File" menu. 
You'll want to give the file a number so that you can keep them in order. 

For example, call the file "01-first-slide.ogg" or something along those lines. 

Select "ogg Vorbis file" from the menu and then press save. 

The dialog will prompt you to add tags. You can if you wish, but it is not necessary. 

You can open a new project for each audio file. 

#### Recording all at once and splitting into separate files
