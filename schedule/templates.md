Over the course of your academic careers (and in your professional lives), you will be faced repeatedly with formatting a document for submission. 
In this class, we are not going to focus too much on the where-do-I-put-the-periods-and-commas stuff, but we will look at how to move from unformatted text to formatted text with relative ease and without repeating tasks that can be automated. 

Publication venues (journals, etc.) will often provide authors with a template for formatting their submissions. 
These days, this will typically be a DOCX file, though science journals also tend to include a TeX file, since scientists write in TeX or LaTeX because it is easy to format mathematical equations and produce beautiful documents. 

Today we will look at a template in LibreOffice, discuss PanDoc for document conversion and finally look at ways to reduce the amount of boring and repetitive work we have so that we can get to the interesting stuff. 

To get us started, here is a link to a template for a paper that uses the APA Style Guide, 6th edition: http://templates.libreoffice.org/template-center/apa-6th-edition

You may find and use whatever other template you like in the [LibreOffice template center](http://templates.libreoffice.org/template-center/). 
If you choose a different template, make sure to email me the link so that I can put them up on the class site for others to access.
