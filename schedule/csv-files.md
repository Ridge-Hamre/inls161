### Lists

We'll start with a list of data. 

Open a new file and name it with your GitHub user account and the extension .list. 

Mine will be `jdmar3.list`. 

Inside the file, I want you to give one-word or numerical answers to the following (as specified), in this order, each on their own line:

What is your GitHub username?
How tall are you (in centimeters)?
What time did you wake up this morning (in 24-hour/military time: e.g., 06:30)?
How many semesters do you have left in your degree program? 
Approximately how far is your home city/town away from UNC/Chapel Hill (in km)?

My file will look like this:

```
jdmar3
175.26
06:45
3
1,129.3
```

Very simple. 

### Comma Separated Values (CSV)

Now that we have listed some information about ourselves, lets try to aggregate our data.
