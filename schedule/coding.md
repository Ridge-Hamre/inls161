Now that we have learned some things about operating on remote systems, we're going to move on to learning how to create and publish content online. 

This week's tasks will involve some very simple coding (markup, really) and continued exploration and use of our system administration skills. 

The first thing that we will do is come up with something to put up online in our GitHub Pages repo. 
Then we will learn how to mark it up so that the structure of the information is apparent to the reader. 
After that, we will convert our markup into a different format entirely, in consideration for web use. 

First things first, we need to know some things about markup. 

Markup has been used over the last several decades to enhance plaintext for web use. 

Today we will consider some of the basics.
