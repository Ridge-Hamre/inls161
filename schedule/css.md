CSS is an acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet."

If HTML is the medium for web content, then CSS is the medium for the visual styling of the web. 
Whenever a website looks like anything other than just a blank page, there is CSS involved. 

Over the course of this week we are going to use Markdown, HTML5 and CSS3 to construct our very own web pages. 

**For tomorrow:**

In preparation, I would like you to read and try out the tutorial contained in the following: 

Wielgosik, D. (2015). [How to Code in HTML5 and CSS3](http://howtocodeinhtml.com/index.html). Retrieved from http://howtocodeinhtml.com/index.html

You will also need to create some content that we will put on your new website. 
I would like you to do this using Markdown. 

Make sure to review [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as well. 
Tomorrow we will talk more about structure and how all of this fits together. 

Also be sure to check out the reference sheets for Markdown, HTML5, and CSS3.
They will be endlessly useful to you as we go forward.
