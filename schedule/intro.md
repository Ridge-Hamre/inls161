Welcome to INLS161!

I'm John, your instructor for INLS161 this summer. 
I am a doctoral student here in the School of Information and Library Science. 

I'm very excited to be working with all of you this summer. 
We are going to do some interesting things here.

This is a course about pushing our boundaries and learning new things. 
It is also about learning new ways of doing things that we might already know how to do. 

Some of the topics and skills covered by the course might be old hat for some of you. 
Others may not have ever heard of some of these things. 

To that end, I would like for everyone to fill out a brief questionnaire. 
We will do this together, in class. 
If you land here before that and want to fill it out, you can find it at the link below:
