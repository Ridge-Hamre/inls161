Once we have our data imported into our tables and our fields have all been properly formatted, we have our basic structure in place. 

We can now start to look at some of the more advanced features of the database and learn to utilize them for our whatever purposes we might have. 

If we want to sort and learn about the data we have, a good first stop is to learn how to query it. 

Queries take a set of instructions and use them to sort and categorize data across multiple variables. 

We will look at different possibilities for queries and try some together in class. 

Please look at this documentation for LibreOffice Base for how to create queries:

[Query Design](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Query_Design)

You will then be asked to create a query on your own.
