### PowerPoint Karaoke

Today we're going to talk about what is wrong with presentations and presentation software as they have come to be used. 

Presentations in class or at conferences are a weapon used to inflict maximum torturous boredom on an audience of unsuspecting victims. 

Slideshows are the main modality of such attacks. 

*	You will typically have to dodge lots of bullets.
*	You will scale walls of illegible text, compressed so that it can fit on a screen. 
*	Presenters will read directly from their slides to you. 

This is all very bad. 

The typical mode for preparing presentations these days seems to be oriented toward allowing anyone to give a presentation, provided that they have the slide deck in front of them. 

The more cynical among us have come to call this exercise PowerPoint karaoke. 

Here are some examples not to follow:

And here is an example of a good presentation slide deck about bad presentations:

### The problem

The problem is not PowerPoint itself. 

PowerPoint is just a tool. 

All tools can be used in various ways for good or ill. 

A knife can be used in the kitchen to prepare food, which feeds people and makes them happy. 
That same knife can also be used as a weapon. 

Like with all of the other tools that we have used, the end product has to do with how we use them. 
Our intentions drive what happens more than the tools we use. 

A rather hilarious example of how a major speech may have gone very differently, had the speaker been compelled to use PowerPoint in today's typical style:
