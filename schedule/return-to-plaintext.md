It is possible to use GUI tools to create and convert documents. 
Support is somewhat limited, but in LibreOffice, we can at least create a PDF from our ODT and DOCX files. 

We can also manipulate the styles of the headers and other structural elements that we have assigned using Markdown in our GUI editors. 

One convenient effect of starting with plaintext marked up with Markdown is that we have those structural elements when we convert them into another format and then edit them elsewhere. It is certainly possible to start in the GUI editor and define the same things, but after becoming acquainted with Markdown, it should feel somewhat more burdensome. Arguably, it is. There is a great deal more that goes into a DOCX or an ODT file, structurally, than in a plaintext file with Markdown in it. 

We also have the disadvantage of only being able to operate on thost files in limited ways on headless or remote systems. 

If we keep plaintext at the core of our workflows and GUI editors toward the periphery, we will be served in the end as we will always have access to our work, on any system, without any huge barriers to editing and changing. 

In the next portion of the class we will learn how to operate similarly on structured data, using both text-based and GUI tools.
