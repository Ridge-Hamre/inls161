In addition to the Edward Tufte piece on the congitive style of PowerPoint, I would like you to have a look at this piece on design and aesthetics for communication:

Greever, T. (2015, June 25). Great Designers are Great Communicators. Retrieved from http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/great-designers-are-great-communicators/

There is a great deal of writing on this topic. 
I recommend having a look around the web and reading about aesthetics and communication. 
It will benefit your practice in the long run. 

### Tools for presentations

#### PowerPoint, the old standby

Here are a few links to useful articles about using PowerPoint in the way that we are aiming at in this class.

#### Zoomy, barfy rollercoaster of fun: Prezi

Prezi is now widely used by presenters who want to break out of the standard model of slide... slide... slide... end. 
It puts the viewer on a giant canvas and then zooms to where we want to focus. 

Be careful, though, it has been known to actually cause motion sickness on occasion. 

Don't make your audience hurl. 
It's not nice.

### ALL YOUR SLIDES ARE BELONG TO GOOGLE: Google Slides

Google Slides is a good, easy interface, but it is a little more difficult to add narration.
