Markdown is a markup language. 
We had a brief introduction to it last week when we established our first repositories on GitHub. 

###Why are we learning Markdown? 

For starters, Markdown is easier to use than HTML or other markup languages. 
It doesn't require complicated tags, which have a high potential for typographical error. 

For some compelling reasons to learn Markdown, consider the following:

We will go over some of the basics in class today, but I would also like you to review the following: 

Mastering Markdown. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

This guide is oriented toward GitHub, but the skills represented there extend well beyond that context. 

We're also going to be learning some HTML today. 
We will work interchangeably in HTML and Markdown over the course of this week.
